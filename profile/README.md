# MECH Toolkit
We have a dream of autonomous MECHs

## What is this?
This is a toolkit for autonomous MECHs. It is a collection of tools and libraries that can be used to create autonomous MECHs.

## What is a MECH?
A MECH is an autonomous robot that operates in the world without human intervention. It can be a drone, an electric car, a excavator, a ship, a plane, a submarine, a space ship, a satelite, a space station, a

## What is the purpose of this toolkit?
The purpose of this toolkit is to provide a set of tools and libraries that can be used to create autonomous MECHs.
The first demonstratable version of this toolkit is be a mech that hunt and Punch each other in the face, because the 11 year old in us things that is just plain cool.
The last demonstratable this toolkit will be a MECH rules the solar system. (Like the Ship Minds from Culture by Ian M Banks)

# Repositories of MECH-toolkit:

- [platforms](https://github.com/mech-toolkit/platforms) - The mechanical and electrical documentation for MECHs.
- [mcu](https://github.com/mech-toolkit/mcu) - repo contains source code for Micro Controler Units.  (The little boards on the MECH that input vision, and ultrasonics and control the servos that move the MECH.)
- [mechlib](https://github.com/mech-toolkit/mechlib) - a small python libary for autonomously controling MECHs.  This integrates networking, vision, and motion control to control the MECH.
- [pretrained](https://github.com/mech-toolkit/pretrained) - The releases of pre-trained AI models for MECHs.
