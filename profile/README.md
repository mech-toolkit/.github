# Autonomous Mech Toolkit
We have a dream of autonomous mechs

## What is this?
This is a toolkit for autonomous mechs. It is a collection of tools and libraries that can be used to create autonomous mechs.

## What is an autonomous mech?
An autonomous mech is a mech that operates in the world without human intervention. It can be a robot, a drone, a vehicle, a ship, a plane, a submarine, a space ship, a space station, a

## What is the purpose of this toolkit?
The purpose of this toolkit is to provide a set of tools and libraries that can be used to create autonomous mechs.
The first demonstratable version of this toolkit will be a mech that hunt and Punch each other in the face, because the 11 year old in us things that is just plain cool.

# Repositories of mech-toolkit:

- [platforms](https://github.com/mech-toolkit/platforms) - The mechanical and electrical documentation for mechs.
- [mcu](https://github.com/mech-toolkit/mcu) - repo contains source code for Micro Controler Units.  (The little boards on the mech that input vision, and ultrasonics and control the servos that move the mech.)
- [mechlib](https://github.com/mech-toolkit/mechlib) - a small python libary for autonomously controling mech's.  This integrates networking, vision, and motion control to control the mech.
- [pretrained](https://github.com/mech-toolkit/pretrained) - The releases of pre-trained AI models for mechs.
