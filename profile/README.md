# MECH Toolkit
We have a dream of MECHs. Autonomous fighting robots!

## What is this?
This is a toolkit for MECHs. It is a collection of tools, part files and libraries that can be used to create MECHs.

## What is a MECH?
A MECH is an autonomous robot that operates in the world without human intervention. It can be a drone, electric car, excavator, ship, plane, submarine, space shuttle, satelite, space station, a whatever you want to be autonomous

## What is the purpose of this toolkit?
The purpose of this toolkit is to provide a set of tools and libraries that can be used to create autonomous MECHs.
The first demonstratable version of this toolkit is be a MECH that can hunt, track and punch each other in the face, because the 11 year old in us thinks that is just plain cool.
The last demonstratable this toolkit will be a MECH rules the solar system. (Like the Ship Minds from Culture by Ian M Banks)

## Where to Start?
It is best to start by reading through our setup guide [here](https://www.instructables.com/Punchy-the-MECH-the-Autonomous-Fight-Club/)

# Repositories of MECH-toolkit:

- [platforms](https://github.com/mech-toolkit/platforms) - The mechanical and electrical documentation for MECHs (3D Print Files, Electrical Diagrams, Sensor Datasheets).
- [mcu](https://github.com/mech-toolkit/mcu) - The source code for Microcontrolers that run on the MECHs (controls wireless comms, input vision, ultrasonics and control the servos that move the MECH).
- [mechlib](https://github.com/mech-toolkit/mechlib) - The python libary for autonomously controling MECHs.  This integrates networking, vision, and motion control to control the MECH.
- [pretrained](https://github.com/mech-toolkit/pretrained) - The releases of pre-trained AI models for MECHs.
